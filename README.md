# Using R with Plumber API for FPL data

This package extracts data from the FPL API. 
Furthermore, it uses Plumber to expose processed data as an API. Thus, the package can be used directly if you
would only like to extract the data for an internal solution. However, if you want to expose the data to other services, Plumber will allow you to do that.
For instance, I use the Plumber API on a Virtual Machine (VM), allowing me to connect a Power BI dashboard directly to that VM as a data source. 
Thus, I don't need to run anything locally to extract my recent data. It also allows me to share the data with friends that are interested!

# Code for running Plumber API
